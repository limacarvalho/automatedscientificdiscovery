Enclose there are 2 datasets for 2020 and two for 2021.
A) 159 countries and 52 columns (covid, cause of death, population density, obesity, air quality)
B) 113 countries and 62 columns ( A +people per household, +smoking_ratios)

Please note that the dataset B) has data from the smoking and household datasets. They are missing some important countries such as Denmark, or Algeria.


WHAT I HAVE DONE
Data were preprocessed (homogenize country names, special characters etc.).
Then data merged by country and I evaluated how many countries were lost in each step
because they were not in the new dataset.
1) remove column if too many NaNs
2) remove rows with NaNs after merging all data together
