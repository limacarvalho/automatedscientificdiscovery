## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

As much as possible try to follow the following rules/guidelines during development:
- Try to use Python3.8 or latest
- Document code whenever feasible
- Do not push code containing API Keys, secrets or any other sensitive information
- Implement timeouts, retries, and backoff with jitter whenever dependent on external APIs
- [Type-hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) are recommended
- Try to follow code formating rules as described in the PEP8 whenever possible. Maybe using [black](https://github.com/psf/black)?
- Push code to "develop" branch and when validate initiate a pull request to "master"

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
